## 📁 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn within a telecommunications company using the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**. The primary goal is to develop predictive models to assess customer churn and monthly charges. Several machine learning techniques, such as **regression, classification, and clustering**, were employed to extract insights and predict customer behavior.  
The dataset comprises 7,043 customers and 21 features including demographic data, account information, and services subscribed.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **ML Techniques:** K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Statistical Tests:** Chi-Squared, T-Test  
- **EDA & Preprocessing:** Encoding, Scaling, Handling missing values

## 🎯 Key Results  
- Achieved **79.89% accuracy** using **Gradient Boosting** for customer churn prediction.
- Identified significant churn factors: **Monthly Charges, Tenure, Contract, Payment Method**.
- Detected **325 outliers** using the **LOF Anomaly Detection** technique.

## 📊 Clustering Insights  
- **Cluster 1:** Customers with **high monthly charges** and **low tenure** are more likely to churn.
- **Cluster 2:** **Long-tenure customers** with high charges are less likely to churn.

## 📈 Model Performance  
- **Regression Models:** Decision Tree Regression achieved the highest accuracy with an **R² of 0.9843**.
- **Classification Models:** Gradient Boosting outperformed others with **79.89% accuracy** in predicting churn.

## 🚀 Conclusion  
This project provides actionable insights into customer churn behavior and suggests strategies for improving retention through better pricing strategies and personalized offerings.
